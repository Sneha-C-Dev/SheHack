<h3 class="al" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Vision</h3>
<p class="al" style="color:rgb(129, 127, 127);">Actually I have basic and theoretical knowledge in a few programing languages but what I lack is the practical implementation. 
Just knowing all the syntax and less practical experience is just like learning to drive by taking online lessons.......Sounds funny right.Well that's the truth.
This is the one thing which pushed me to register for SheHacks .
<br><br>
"Gain knowledge, learn something new and update existing knowledge. And most important of all to work as a team."</p>
<h3 class="al" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Mission</h3>
<p class="al" style="color:rgb(105, 105, 105);">I would like to see a great deal of improvement in my skills compared to my old self. Well , that's the major expectation even though it sounds cliche.
<br>"To move an inch atleast from where I was standing yesterday."</p>
<h1 class="al" style="color:rgb(153, 10, 235);"><u>Chandana</u></h1>
<h3 class="al" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Vision</h3>
<p class="al" style="color:rgb(105,105,105);"> To be my best self in doing the things that I love. I want to explore my creative side through learning design and web development.
    That's why I am choosing Shehacks. I hope to learn and embibe new perceptions.</p>
<h3 class="al" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Misssion</h3>
<p class="al" style="color:rgb(105,105,105);">I will pursue things that matter to me. Continuously improving and evolving myself, to lend a helping hand and work together for a better world.</p>
<h1 class="al" style="color:rgb(153, 10, 235);"><u>Sneha C</u></h1>
<h3 class="al" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Vision</h3>
<p class="al" style="color:rgb(105,105,105);">It's been so long since I done something I planned to do. Especially to learn. There are thousands of sources available,and even a will to study, but something pushes me back from it.
    In search of better way to make me start doing things I found about SheHacks. It was like...'There you go'....as far as I'm concerned rather than sitting and studying something it will be effective 
    if we take the things we learn into a creative and practical level.
    So here I'm to improve, learn, work and engage.  
</p>
<h3 class="al" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Mission</h3>
<p class="al" style="color:rgb(105,105,105);">Improve the existing knowledge . Learn and Explore new things. Work effetively and creatively in a group. And Engage myself in something worthy.</p>
